Name validation is good:

    assign player ID using for loop to generate id's driven by last index of dictionary
    store player's names and id's in a dictionary sorted by player name

Name-filter:

    Filter out list of un-usable names from a dictionary. e.g., npc's, imm's

Logs:

    Needs accurate logging/reporting system


General Notes:

    use a dictionary to store game default values e.g., (max_hp, level, room_id)
    instantiate player objects at a starting location with default values accessed from dictionary
